**Planned Features:**
- 🔍 **Prescription OCR**: Extract text from prescription images
- 📊 **Lab Report Scanning**: Digitize lab result documents
- 💊 **Pill Identification**: Identify medications from photos
- 📄 **Medical Document Analysis**: Process health records

**Current Status:** Development in progress
**Expected Launch:** Q1 2026

**Why the wait?**
Vision-language models require additional integration and testing to ensure medical-grade accuracy for patient safety.

⚠️ This feature will provide image analysis assistance but will NOT replace professional medical document review.

*Thank you for your patience as we build this feature!*`;
